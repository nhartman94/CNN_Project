    "1. Try increasing the number of nodes in the output layer to see if you're losing too much info from these initial convolutions.\n",
    "The acc got up to about 74.5%, but was then plateauing, so I stopped the the training. Then... I tried adding another hidden layer (so 3 fc layers before classification) to see if I was eroding too much of the model info when I was doing these up and down sampling pre-convolutions. The accuracy got up to 75.47%, so I'm going to try *decreasing* the learning rate by a factor of 10 (so now $\\alpha=10^{-5}$) and trying another 10 epochs of training, and that got it down to 75.86% accuracy.\n",
    "Just to be sure I knew *where* my improvements were coming from, and that I was comparing apples to apples, I tried retraining with two final fc layers using $\\alpha=10^{-4}$ for 10 epochs, and then $\\alpha=10^{-5}$ for another 10 epochs. This didn't help my validation accuracy at all, but I decided not to use 3 fc layers for my next few experiments, keeping in mind that these are the types of gains I should be able to achieve by tweaking the convolutional layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next I tried doubling the number of filters in my two 3d convolutional layers to 32 and 16. This helped a little bit (75% accuracy), but I think the issue is that I need a better pre-convolutional architecture.\n",

    "3. Try using 8 channels for each of the pre-conv layers\n",
    "    - For layer0, I ended up using 4 filters for the downsampling convolution, and 8 filters for the upsampling convolution.\n",
    "    Now I'm at 75% within 3 epochs... (not bad), and my validation acc after 10 epochs with $\\alpha=1e-4$ is 75.68%. After training another 10 epochs with $\\alpha=1e-5$, the val acc gets up to 75.87%\n",

    "5. For layer2, instead of just duplicating this layer 16 times, try a filter with $3\\times3$ filters that is weight preserving so you can learn different higher level features from this repn while preserving the spatial information.\n",
    "I got to ()% accuracy, so I don't really think that that helped. But now that I'm  using more features, should I be using more overfitting safeguards, like batchnorm + dropout?\n",
    "I tried that, it didn't really help, 74.84% val acc ;-(\n",
    "\n",

    "1. I wrote some new downsampling layers that use 2d convolutions and downsampling layers to compress the image. The default filters from the 3d-convolutions no longer fit, so I decided first to not compress the image, but use $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ filters with a stride of 1 to compress info from across the image: 10 epochs 2.5e-5, 5 epochs 2.5e-6: 76.57%\n",

    "2. Next: Try adding 2d BatchNorm in the pre-convolutional layers (it was acutally really stupid of me not to have tried this before) 5 epochs for 2.5e-5, 2.5e-6, 1e-6 $\\rightarrow 77.3%$. *First time I broke 77% with a convolutional model!!!*\n",
    "But I feel like the major lesson here is it's *very* important to be careful with these preconvolutional layers to not wash away too much of the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are *a lot* of params in the current network right now: 186k! I saw with the fc when I increased the number of parameters, the performance got *worse*, so try to find some ways to *reduce* the number of parameters. \n",

    "The bottleneck is probably the connection from the 3d conv to the fc layers.\n",
