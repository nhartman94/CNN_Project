# Classifying Electromagnetic Showers from Calorimeter Images with CNNs

## Algorithms

This repository contains code for constructing various neural networks to classify particles from the Micky et. al. dataset based on energy deposition. The map below provides a brief explanation of each file, and a summary of the notebooks that were important to our project's development. An in-depth discussion of the network architectures can be found in the paper "Classifying Electromagnetic Showers from Calorimeter Image swith CNNs", by Nicole Hartman and Sean Mullane.
